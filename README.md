A fork of [Anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki) with a curses front-end.

The curses interface is not currently capable of being a complete replacement for the GUI (qt), but its features (see below) aim to cover most typical studying requirements.

## Features
- Basic Deck Browsing
- Support for Basic Cards and Cloze Cards (Cloze deletion)
- Note Editing (directly from reviewer)
- Sync
- Configuration File
